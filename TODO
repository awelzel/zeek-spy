- Read version symbol and expect "3.0.1"

- Do not be so GCC specific.

  Collect offsets/functions for reading the memory into a separate interface/type.
  Dispatch based on heuristics.

- Find a way to find out the compiler version or type.

- Use `syscall.StartProcess` and start tracing the child

  Not sure we actually need to do the ptrace attach dance. We can just
  start tracing the resulting process instead.


- use `process_vm_readv` without stopping the process?

  There does not seem to be a wrapper for x86_64 linux.
